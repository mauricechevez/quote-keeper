Need to do:
So much but here's what I remember:
1. Create a way to add new quotes based on a Quote object constructor - DONE âœ…

2. Create way to edit the quote - DONE âœ…
When edit button is clicked,
* Grab value from the quote input field
* insert it into the current quote data value
* push that into the data structure
* return to Submit state (cleareditstate)

3. Create way to delete the quote (splice) - DONE âœ…

4. Hide the list if no data is present DONE âœ…
* When deleting all the items manually, hide the list. Need to create function that checks for the length of the array of quotes to run each time an individual quote is deleted. DONE âœ…

* once the storage is added I can use logic to determine if it is shown at launch of not based on if anything exists in storage DONE âœ…
* 

5. If in the Edit state, prevent the ENTER key from being used. - DONE âœ…

6. Create a way to clear all the quotes.
* Clear all quotes from the Data structure DONE âœ…
* Clear all quotes from the List items DONE âœ…
* Confirm with user if they want to continue (should be first action) DONE âœ…
* Hide the UL and Header DONE âœ…
* If no items in list, prevent the Clear All btn from being able to be used. DONE âœ…

7 Setup the LocalStorage functionality
* Add item to LocalStorage DONE âœ…
* Update/Edit item in LocalStorage and save it. DONE âœ…
* Delete 1 item from LocalStorage DONE âœ…
* Clear all from LocalStorage DONE âœ…

8. Count all quotes, show them on screen. DONE âœ…

9. Add hover colors to the other buttons DONE âœ…

10. Add Author's name to the data structure, form, and all functionality. DONE âœ…

11. If no quotes available, provide ability to fill up the list with a sample listing.
* JSON File? Try with an object first ðŸš§ ðŸ¦º

12. Add the DATE of quote submission to the form.
* Perform the same steps as when adding the Author name, except you need to get the date automatically using the Date object. DONE âœ…

13. If either/or fields are empty, prevent submission, and put some indicator regarding the missing information.DONE âœ…

* Add text below the input itself DONE âœ…
* Prevent a space from being inserted in the beginning of the field (prevent whitespace - you can use regex) DONE âœ…
* Use this solution by creating another function that checks the field data: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43074658/stop-form-whitespace-when-user-pressing-submit DONE âœ…

14. Sort the list by date. Descending order.

* Look at lines 228-244 for new updates regarding this.
When comparing b first, that is descending
